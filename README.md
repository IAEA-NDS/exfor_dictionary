# Introduction to the EXFOR Dictionary in JSON

EXFOR entries contain a variety of keywords, for example:

> INSTITUTE  (1USALAS)
> REFERENCE  (R,LA-1258,1951)
> FACILITY   (CCW,1USALAS)
> DETECTOR   (THRES)
> REACTION   (2-HE-4(N,2N)2-HE-3,,SIG,,SPA)
> STATUS     (DEP,14737002)

These keywords are defined in the **EXFOR dictionary**, which is maintained by the IAEA Nuclear Data Section.
This repository provides a JSON-converted version of the dictionary: [latest file](src/exfor_dictionary/latest.json).

## Structure of the EXFOR Dictionary

The EXFOR dictionary contains approximately 40 categories of identifiers, called **`DICTION` blocks**.
The original dictionary is stored in a fixed-width FORTRAN-style format.

Each `DICTION` block begins with the keyword `DICTION` and contains a list of EXFOR codes along with descriptions.
For instance, the code `1USALAS` corresponds to *Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM* and is defined in `DICTION 3 Institutes`.

All dictionary identifiers are summarized in `DICTION 950`. A shortened example:

```
DICTION            950     202112 List of Dictionaries  
  1        System identifiers                           
  2        Information identifiers                      
  3        Institutes

## Using the JSON-Formatted EXFOR Dictionary

An example Jupyter notebook is available here:
üìì [example.ipynb](https://github.com/IAEA-NDS/exfor_dictionary/blob/main/example/example.ipynb)

If you do not have a local Jupyter environment, you can launch the example directly in Binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IAEA-NDS/exfor_dictionary/main?labpath=example/example.ipynb)

### Example usage in Python

```python
import json

# Load the latest EXFOR dictionary
with open("src/exfor_dictionary/latest.json") as j:
    exfor_dictionary = json.load(j)
```

List all available `DICTION` categories:

```python
for i, k in exfor_dictionary["definitions"].items():
    print(i, "-->", k["description"])
```

Inspect a specific keyword, e.g. `INSTITUTE (1USALAS)`:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(
    exfor_dictionary["dictionaries"]["3"]["codes"]["1USALAS"], 
    indent=2
))
```

## EXFOR Dictionary Parser

The parser script [`exfor_dictionary.py`](exfor_dictionary.py) automatically downloads the latest EXFOR dictionary from the [IAEA NDS website](https://nds.iaea.org/nrdc/ndsx4/trans/dictionaries/).

It processes the source file into `DICTION` blocks, storing:

* the original format in the `original/` directory
* the JSON-converted version in the `json/` directory

During conversion, some abbreviations in descriptions are expanded for clarity.

Since the EXFOR dictionary is updated irregularly, you can re-run the conversion using:

```bash
python convert_dictionary.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The IAEA-NDS "Open Area" is currently password-protected. To update the dictionary, you must set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAREA_USER=<username>
export OPENAREA_PWD=<password>
```

---

## Current Status

* Parsing is still under development.
* JSON files are currently generated only for selected `DICTION` blocks relevant to the EXFOR parser.
* Further improvements are ongoing.
